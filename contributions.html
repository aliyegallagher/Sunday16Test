      <p>Prof. Dobrev is mentioned by his former students (see Professor Christo Kaligorov) as ″not merely a great scientist, but an outstanding educator and a pedagogue″.[1][2]Professor Kosta Pergelov spoke of his ″contribution as the founder of contemporary accountancy theory in Bulgaria, who is rightly regarded by the generations as the patriarch of accountancy in Bulgaria″.[3][4]
In his academic work, „Strategic accountancy analysis of value-revolutionary stage in the development of accountancy science“ Volume I, 2004,p. 33, Docent Trifon Trifonov, cites that “according to D. Dobrev, “...categories of monetary values... separately do not accomplish evaluated movements (economic turnover), except for their being placed in one unified functional entirety... as it is necessary for these forces to be drawn from their concrete material characteristic over one common denominator of the monetary-valuation enumeration” (as cited in Dobrev, D., Science of the separate economy, Printing House H.G.Danov, O.O.Society, Sofia, 1941, p. 108)”.[5]
